The primary objective of the Honeycomb Bravo Plugin is to facilitate the seamless integration of the Honeycomb Bravo control module with X-Plane, eliminating the dependency on the Aerosoft AFC bridge or the Honeycomb configurator. This independent plugin is designed to autonomously identify the loaded aircraft and dynamically implement the appropriate configuration for that specific aircraft, provided that the corresponding profile is already incorporated into the plugin.

The development of this plugin was motivated by the incompatibility of the Aerosoft configurator and the AFC bridge with Macs using Apple Silicon architecture. Notably, the plugin has undergone thorough testing on Apple Silicon, both with and without Rosetta, and has also been validated on Mac Intel systems. While its compatibility with Windows and Linux is anticipated, further testing on these operating systems is required to confirm seamless functionality.

By offering a Mac-friendly alternative, this plugin serves as a versatile solution, ensuring that users can enjoy a streamlined and efficient experience when utilizing the Honeycomb Bravo hardware with X-Plane, irrespective of their operating system.
